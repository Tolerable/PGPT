# PGPT Chat & Images

PGPT is a chatbot and image-generating tool built using Tkinter for the interface, allowing users to chat with a persona-driven AI and receive AI-generated images in response to specific prompts.

## Features

- **Chat System**: A text-based chat system with a custom persona that can be edited in real-time.
- **Image Generation**: Generates AI images based on prompts embedded in the conversation, such as `![SELFIE](prompt)`.
- **Settings Management**: The persona and image style settings are stored in a `settings.json` file and can be edited through the UI.
- **Retry Logic**: Includes retry logic for AI conversation errors, with configurable delays between retries.
- **Dynamic Image Display**: Displays images generated by AI directly within the chat window, allowing users to click and view an enlarged version.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Tolerable/PGPT.git
    ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies**:
    Make sure you have the required Python libraries installed:
    ```bash
    pip install requests pillow
    ```

3. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    python PGPT.py
    ```

## Usage

- **Editing Persona**: Click on "Options" in the menu and select "Edit Persona" to change the persona that guides the chatbot's responses.
- **Editing Image Style**: Similarly, you can adjust the image style prompts by selecting "Edit Photo Style".
- **Sending Messages**: Type your message into the text box and press "Enter" to send it. The AI will respond, and if thereâ€™s an image request in the response, it will be generated and displayed in the chat window.
